## Project Details

### Abstract

The proposed research project aims to conduct action research on OpenGov systems, particularly focusing on mechanisms of decentralized governance, participatory decision-making, and the application of governance frameworks within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of these systems and provide actionable insights to improve the governance processes.

### Motivation

OpenGov represents a significant innovation in decentralized governance, promising more democratic, transparent, and efficient decision-making processes. However, the practical implementation of these systems presents challenges, including participation barriers, potential centralization of influence, and ensuring the sustainability of governance processes. This research is motivated by the need to address these challenges by generating empirical data and insights that can inform the development of more effective governance systems.

### Research Overview

1. **Problem Statement:**  
   The main problem this research addresses is understanding the practical implications of OpenGov systems within the Polkadot and Kusama networks. Specifically, the research will explore how these governance frameworks function in practice, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

2. **Research Questions:**  
   - How do participants in OpenGov systems interact with the governance mechanisms?
   - What factors influence participation and decision-making in these decentralized systems?
   - How can the design of OpenGov frameworks be improved to enhance participation, transparency, and efficiency?

3. **Methodology:**  
   The research will adopt an action research methodology, involving iterative cycles of data collection, analysis, and feedback. The research process will include:
   - **Literature Review:** Surveying existing research on decentralized governance and participatory decision-making.
   - **Case Studies:** Conducting in-depth studies of governance processes within Polkadot and Kusama.
   - **Surveys and Interviews:** Engaging with participants in OpenGov systems to gather qualitative and quantitative data.
   - **Data Analysis:** Using statistical and thematic analysis methods to interpret the data collected.
   - **Actionable Recommendations:** Providing concrete suggestions for improving OpenGov systems based on research findings.

### Deliverables

1. **Research Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the research findings, including insights into the functioning of OpenGov systems, participation dynamics, and recommendations for system improvements.
2. **Open Access Publication:** Publishing the research findings in an open-access format to ensure the results are widely accessible.
